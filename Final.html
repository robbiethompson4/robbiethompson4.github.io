<h1> My Final</h1>
<p> My final project is a game for entertainment that I've decided to call "Asteroid Runner". In this game, your spaceship is caught up in an asteroid storm on your way back to your home planet. The asteroid storms will vary in lenth and in the size of the asteroids randomly each time you play the game. You task is to avoid any and all asteroids by rising and falling in your ship by toggling and untoggling the spacebar. The timer is for the player to keep track of how long they've been in the strom, and should be used to gauge a rough estimate of how many more asteroids are to come. There are no lives in this game and any collison with asteroids will result in your systems failing and the end of the game. </p>
